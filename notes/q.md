## Redux

* Is there only one store for the whole Application? If so:
    - How to manager multiple unrelated states? store all of them in one state
      object?
    - Is a performance problem when actions or states are growing up very
      largely?
    - Does **combineReducer** has a executing order for those reducer it
      including?
